    <ol>
      	<li>Add 2 tablespoons of yeast to half a cup of warm water.</li>
     	<li>Stir in a half-teaspoon of sugar. (The warm water helps activate the yeast)</li>

      	<li>Whisk the remaining salt, sugar and three cups of flour together in a mixing bowl.</li>
		<li>Add the oil and yeast mixture and beat until it is smooth.</li>
		<li>Once the dough is smooth, add in the remaining flour half a cup at a time until you have a soft dough. </li>
		<li>Remove the dough and place it on a flat surface.</li>
		<li>Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Let the dough rest for 30 minutes for it to rise.</li>
		<li>Oil the loaf pan and place your dough in it.</li>
		<li>Pop the loaves into a 375ยบ oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
		<li>Once baked, remove from the oven and let the pans cool for 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Finally your bread is ready. Enjoy your freshly baked bread! </li>
